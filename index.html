          <li>This research focuses on developing a fusion of CNN and RNN model to gain a deeper insight into HAR, coupled with the improvement of its classification accuracy.Furthermore, the widespread use of self-collected data and multimodal sensor data has been questionable as they are not convenient to use and some results may be biased. Therefore, this research used two widely accepted public datasets which are the UCI and WISDM datasets to evaluate the proposed model. This research also has evaluated the effect of hyperparameter on the performance of the model.</li>

  jQuery is a common JavaScript library for reading and making changes to the
  Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree that contains information
  about what is actually visible on a website.

  While HTML is a static document, the browser converts HTML to the
  DOM and the DOM can change. In fact, JavaScript's power comes from
  its ability to manipulate the DOM, which is essentially a JavaScript
  object. When JavaScript makes something interesting happen on a
  website, it's likely the action happened because JavaScript changed
  the DOM. jQuery is fast and easy to use, but it doesn't do anything
  you can't accomplish with vanilla (regular) JavaScript.
